Welcome to the homepage of the Soil Food Web Ontology

## Summary

The Soil Food Web Ontology (SFWO) is an OWL ontology that provides a formal representation of the terminology and concepts in the field of soil trophic ecology. The SFWO is a collaborative and ongoing endeavour aimed at establishing consensus and formal definitions for the array of concepts relevant to soil trophic ecology (diets, food resources, trophic processes/interactions/groups). Its primary objective is to enhance the accessibility, interpretation, combination, reuse, and automated processing of trophic data to support soil food-web research.
